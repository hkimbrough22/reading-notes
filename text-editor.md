# Text Editors
## What is a Text Editor?
-Writes and manages text, particularly to build a website and/or program

## Types
- All systems come with built-in text editors; Mac has *Text Edit* and Windows has *Notepad*
- Consider a third-party option as they offer user-friendly features to generally expedite efficient writing and increase your ability to store, manage, and troubleshoot your files.
- Some of the features third-party applications, sometimes called Integrated Development Environments (IDE), have include:
1. **Code completion**
2. **Syntax highlighting**
3. **Variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)**
4. **The ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them**
