#Git Introduction

##What is Git?

- Git is a version control system. A Version Control System (VCS) allows you to revisit various versions of a file by recording changes. 
- Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes
- This also allows developers collaborate and even work on same code at the same time and remedy issues quickly and efficiently.

## Control Systems
- Through the years, VCS have changed from Local VCS, to Centralized VCS, and finally Distributed VCS (DVCS).
- Each progression of the VCS addressed overarching deficiencies with the previous "model".
- With the DVCS, developers bypassed the potential single point of failure with the Centralized VCS, i.e. the server involved in storage.
- DVCS allows users to create mirrored versions of repositories that can be easily be placed on the server to replace any lost information.
- This is the main tool for devleoper collaboration and simultaneous workflows.

## How?
- Using **Git Commands** and the Add, Commit, Push (ACP) process, developers are able to pull 


 When using Git for coding, the *commit* function represent successive versions of files or a "save as".
- Each "save as" points to snapshot in time.
- Commit messages are used to have a narrative record of tracked changes. Like a caption for each snapshot.
- These *commits* keep track of what files looked like at different points in time in case you need to revert to an older version.
