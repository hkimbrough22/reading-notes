#Notes for 28 June

Today we set up our accounts that allow us as students to track and plan our day-to-day as well as to communicate with the instructor and each other.

We discussed GitHub and created our first live webpage using Markdown.

Markdown is a simplified version of HTML that focuses on content delivery and less on intense functionality or aestetics.

It prevents you from having to learn a large amount of HTML syntax when all you need is to just to get some general information out.
