# Code 201 Reading Notes 
## Hello!
- My name is Haustin Kimbrough. I currently reside in Vail, Arizona with my wife and newbown daughter, **Winter Sofia**. I am originally from Tennessee, but being an Army brat and, eventually, a soldier myself, I found my way to Arizona.  I am currently an educator of Human Intelligence Collectors at Fort Huachuca, AZ, but will soon be leaving my position to pursue the **Code Fellows** program fully.
- I love video games and all things nastalgia. The ~~80's~~ 90s was the best! [Runescape](https://www.runescape.com/community), Pokemon, and *Dragonball Z* often come to mind!
