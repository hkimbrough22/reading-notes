## Trees
1. Binary Trees
2. Binary Search Trees
3. K-ary Trees

### Common Terminology
- Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain itâ€™s own values, and references to other nodes
- Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
- K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
- Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
- Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
- Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
- Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
- Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

### Depth-First Traversals
![Depth-First Traversals](../tree-example.png)
- Pre-order: A, B, D, E, C, F
- In-order: D, B, E, A, F, C
- Post-order: D, E, B, F, C, A

Uses Stacks to operate.

### Breadth-First Traversals
- Output: A, B, C, D, E, F

Uses Queue.
