## Location
Using the Google Play services location APIs, your app can request the last known location of the user's device. In most cases, you are interested in the user's current location, which is usually equivalent to the last known location of the device.

Specifically, use the fused location provider to retrieve the device's last known location. The fused location provider is one of the location APIs in Google Play services. It manages the underlying location technology and provides a simple API so that you can specify requirements at a high level, like high accuracy or low power. It also optimizes the device's use of battery power.

Apps whose features use location services must request location permissions, depending on the use cases of those features.

Within an **activity's** `onCreate()`:
```aidl
private FusedLocationProviderClient fusedLocationClient;

// ..

@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    // ...

    fusedLocationClient = LocationServices.getFusedLocationProviderClient(this);
}
```

Using `getLastLocation()`:
```aidl
fusedLocationClient.getLastLocation()
        .addOnSuccessListener(this, new OnSuccessListener<Location>() {
            @Override
            public void onSuccess(Location location) {
                // Got last known location. In some rare situations this can be null.
                if (location != null) {
                    // Logic to handle location object
                }
            }
        });
```

#### Alternatives
`getCurrentLocation()` gets a fresher, more accurate location more consistently. However, this method can cause active location computation to occur on the device

This is the recommended way to get a fresh location, whenever possible, and is safer than alternatives like starting and managing location updates yourself using requestLocationUpdates(). If your app calls requestLocationUpdates(), your app can sometimes consume large amounts of power if location isn't available, or if the request isn't stopped correctly after obtaining a fresh location.
