### DRY
- Don't Repeat Yourself
- Aimed at reducing repetition of software patterns, replacing it with abstractions or using data normalization to avoid redundancy.
### Rule of Three
- Rule of thumb to decide when similar pieces of code should be refactored to avoid duplication. It states that two instances of similar code do not require refactoring, but when similar code is used three times, it should be extracted into a new procedure.
- Duplication is considered a bad practice in programming because it makes the code harder to maintain.
### You Aren't Gonna Need It
- YAGNI
- Principle of extreme programming (XP) that states a programmer should not add functionality until deemed necessary.
- Do the simplest thing that could possibly work.
### Minimum Variable Product
- A version of a product with just enough features to be usable by early customers who can then provide feedback for future product development.
- A focus on releasing an MVP means that developers potentially avoid lengthy and (ultimately) unnecessary work.
