- LL is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other.
- Singly and Doubly - refers to number of references the node has.
- Singly has one reference - next
- Doubly has two - next and previous
- Nodes are the individual pieces of data in the list
- Each Node contains a property called NExt (references next Node in sequence)
- Head refers to first Node
- Current refers to current Node being looked at.
- Create a Current at the Head to ensure you start from beginning.
