## Java Basics

- Instance Variables
- Class Variables
- Local Variables
- Parameters

- Variable names
    - Case sensitive
    - Can begin with letter, $, or _
    - Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscore characters
    - Camel-case

- Expressions
An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations, which are constructed according to the syntax of the language, that evaluates to a single value.
- Statements
Statements are roughly equivalent to sentences in natural languages. A statement forms a complete unit of execution.
- Blocks
A block is a group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed.
-Control Flow Statements
The statements inside your source files are generally executed from top to bottom, in the order that they appear. Control flow statements, however, break up the flow of execution by employing decision making, looping, and branching, enabling your program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code.

## Reading Java Documentation

- docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/
- To create the API documentation, the captains of Java ran a program called javadoc. The javadoc program took lines like these right out of the PrintStream.java file and used the lines to make the documentation that you see in your web browser.

- Other Java programmers do the same thing. In fact, everyone who writes Java code uses the javadoc program to generate documentation. So everyone’s Java documentation looks like everyone else’s Java documentation. When you know how read to the standard API documentation, you know how to read anybody’s homegrown Java docs.

- And yes, you can use the javadoc program to create your own documentation. When you download the JDK, you get the javadoc program as part of the deal.
