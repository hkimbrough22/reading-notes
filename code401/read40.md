## Open-Source Software Contributions

First timer contributions are normally very small and easy (One recent first-timers-only issue was literally three lines of simple changes! And the changes were described in great detail and tested by the project maintainer). 

But this makes it easier for the contributor to **get the hang of the contribution process rather than the contribution itself**. Remember, this isnâ€™t as much about getting your project features implemented quickly as it is about helping first timers.
