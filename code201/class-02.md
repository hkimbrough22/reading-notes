## Basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript

### Text

Text can be shown in HTML using several different ways.

- Headings - represented with `<h1>` through `<h6>` tags
- Paragraphs - represented with `<p>`tags

#### Styling

- Bold - with `<b>` tag
- Italics - with `<i>` tag
- Superscript and Subscript - with `<sup>` and `<sub>`, respectively.
- Line breaks - with `<br>` tags
- Horizontal line - with `<hr>` tags


#### Other Useful Text Features

- `strong`
- `em`
- `blockquote`
- `q`
- `abbr`
- `cite`
- `dfn`
- `address`
- `ins`
- `del`
- `s`

### CSS

- CSS uses block-level elements for its processing.
- Uses a selector and declaration.
- Inline, internal, and external.
- Inline somewhat frowned upon.
- Internal also not really industry standard, but can be done with `<style>` element in the head section of the HTML.
- Mostly use external, which links an external CSS document to the HTML through the `<link>` element, usually found in the head section of the HTML.
- CSS uses selectors to identify what specific pieces of the document to style. Noteable ones include universal (`*`), type (`h1` or `p`), class (`.`) and id (`#`).


### Javascript

- Javascript uses scripts to function. Scripts are step-by-step instructions to perform a task.
- Each step in the instructions is known as a statement. Statements end with a semicolon.
- Comments are often used to explain what your code does or other pertinent information about a part of your code.
- JS and most code uses variables.
- Variables can be strings, numbers, and/or boolean values.
- An array is a special type of variable that stores a list of values.
- The values in an array are assigned a position starting with the number zero (0) and can be called upon just like any other variable.
- JS uses arithmetic, if statements, and loops to perform many operations and produce a function.
- Loops check to see if a statement returns `true`, if it does the code runs again, if it returns `false` the code stops.
