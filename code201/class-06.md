### Const
- A constant variable. To be used when we have a variable set to a value that never changes.
- Helps prevent errors.

Arrays and objects can be declared with `const`.


### Objects
- Convenient ways to group data and functions
- Store data as properties, which are represented as key values: value pairs, and can have methods, which are functions associated with the object.
-Similar to array, but with semantic element names

#### Anatomy of Objects
- curly braces, not parens
- dot notation
