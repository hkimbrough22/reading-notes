# Code 201 - Reading Notes
<!-- All notes were taken from Reading assignment 11 references in Jon Duckett's book -->
## Audio, Video, and Images
### Images
- Use `height` and `width` properties for images to help websites load quicker. Telling the website how much space to allocate even before the picture is downloaded helps.
- Determine and assign class values for small, medium, and large images.
- Similiarly, assign class values for "align-left" or "align-right" when needing to float HTML images. These two are used in conjunction together.
- You can assign images as backgrounds using `backgroung-image`.
- Use `background-position` to move the background image. This property has pair values, i.e. center top, left bottom, right top, etc.

### Practical Information
- Search Engine Optimization - trying to get your site to appear nearer the top of search engine results.
- Work out which terms people are likely to enter into a search engine to find your site and then using these terms in the right place on your site.
- On-page and off-page techniques.
- Google Analytics service to help determine the amount of people visiting your site.
- To transfer your code and images from your computer to your hosting company, you use File Transfer Protocol.
