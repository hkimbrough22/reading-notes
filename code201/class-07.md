## Object-Oriented Programming and HTML Tables
### Tables
- Represents information in a grid format.
- Uses
`table`, `th`, `tr`, `td` to create. These are "table heading", "table row", and "table data", respectively.
- Use attribute "colspan" to have assign a row to more than one column: `<td colspan = "3">Gym</td>` here, the row would take up three columns.
- Use attribute "rowspan" to have assign a column to more than one row: `<td rowspan = "3">Gym</td>` here, the column would take up three rows.
- `thead`, `tbody`, and `tfoot` should be used in the `table` element to distinguish the different parts of the table.
- You can style individual cells or the whole table in CSS with `width` and `border`.


### Function, Objects, and Methods
- Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task.
- An Object is a series of variables and functions taht represent something from the world around you.
- In an object, variables are known as properties of the object and functions are methods of the object.
- Web browsers implement objects that represent both the browser window and the document loaded into the browser window.
- JA also has several built-in objects such as `string`, `number`, `Math`, and `Date`.
- Arrays are special objects that hold related data types (typically) .
- Pgs. 133-135 discuss Math object and decimal places.
- Pgs. 136 and 137 discuss Date object.
