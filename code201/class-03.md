# Code 201 - Reading Notes
<!-- All notes were taken from Reading assignment 2 references in Jon Duckett's book -->
## HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model
### HTML
- There are three type of HTML lists.
  - Ordered lists organize items with numbers
  - Unordered lists organize with bullets.
  - Definition lists are used to define terminology.
- List can be nested in one another.

## CSS
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box
- You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box by manipulating the margin, border, padding, or even the element.
- You can hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
- Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, vice versa.

## Javascript
- Switch statements have a default option the run if none of the cases mathc.
- If a match is found, that code is run. The code will continue unless a `break` statements stops the switch.
- Switch statements provide better performance than if/else statements because the if/else will continue to run through its code while the switch does not.
- Switch statements are also handy for many options (roughly, more than 4).
- Javascript uses weak typing meaning values can be coerced to fit into a function.
- There are three types of loops:
  1. `for`
  2. `while`
  3. `do... while`
  Each repeats set statements until a condition is met from the argument.
