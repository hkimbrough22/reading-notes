# Code 201 - Reading Notes
<!-- All notes were taken from Reading assignment 4 references in Jon Duckett's book -->
## HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout
### HTML
 - Links are created using the `a` and `href` tags
 - The link calls for a reference location and what the user will see to be able to go to the reference location.
 - You can link to other sites, other locations in the current site, pictures, email, and others.
 - You can open the link in a new tab on the browser by using the `target` attribute and assigning it to `_blank`.



 ### CSS
 - CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box.
 - The box will either be block-level or inline.
 - Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout
 - Inline boxes flow between surrounding text.
 - Control the size of boxes by adjusting width and height properties.
 - Control boxes with the `position` attribute and the different possible values - `static`, `relative`, `absolute`, and `fixed`.
 - Other positioning attirbutes include `z-index` and `float`
 - You can create multi-column layouts using `float` and `div`.
 - Fixed-width layout (pixels) versus Liquid layout (percentages) - Page 393 of book!


 ### JS
 - Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform specific tasks.
 - If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function.
 - You must declare the function and then call the function.
 - You can give parameters for the function that need certain information to operate.

 #### Scope
 - The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used within your code.
 - If you declare it within a function, it can only be used within that function (scope).
 - Variables are local (var), global (declared outside of a function).
