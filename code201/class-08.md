# Code 201 - Reading Notes
<!-- All notes were taken from Reading assignment 8 references in Jon Duckett's book -->
## CSS Layout
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box.
- The box will either be block-level or inline.
- Block-level starts on a new "line" or space, inline does not.
- Elements within elements are children. The element containing the element are the parent.

### Positioning Property
- `static` - normal flow
- `relative` - moves element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow
- `absolute` - taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements
- `fixed` - positions the element in relation to the browser window.
- `z-index` - pushes or pulls the element below or above other elements, respectively
- `float` - take an element in normal flow and place it as far left or right of the container as possible.
- Important to remember screen sizes, devices, and aiming for liquid layouts that stretch and contract as needed with user experience.
- Use `link` for CSS sheets.
