## Functional Programming

### Concepts
<!-- https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa -->
1. What is functional programming?
A way of building structure and elements of a program that treats computation as the evaluation of functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
REturns the same results if given the same arguments
3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
Independent, testable, replicable
4. What is immutability?
Can't be changed over time
5. What is Referential transparency?
A function consistently yielding the same result for same input. Pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency.

### Node.js Modules and Require()

1. What is a module?
A seperate file that is called for a specific purpose/when needed.
2. What does the word ‘require’ do?
