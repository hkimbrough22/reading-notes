# Code 301 - Reading Notes

## NODE.JS

### An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com
<!-- https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/ -->
1. What is node.js?
    - JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
    - A way for Chrome to read JS code efficiently.
3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
    - It is a program we can use to run JS on our computers.
4. What is npm?
    - Node Package Manager
5. What version of node are you running on your machine?
    - 14.17.5
6. What version of npm are you running on your machine?
    - 6.14.14
7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?
    - npm install -g
8. What is node used for?
    - Runs various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.
    - Modern JS frameworks rely on Node to create a sensible development environment in which they can run.

### 6 Reasons for Pair Programming
<!-- https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/ -->
1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
    - Greater efficiency
    - Engaged collaboration
    - Learning from fellow students
    - Social skills
    - Job interview readiness
    - Work environment readiness
2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
    - The job interview readiness and work environment readiness seem as though they are the most beneficial for myself. The others are nice, but really diving into the code and being able to talk about it and actually speak what you want to happen cements your understanding and makes you sound professional.
3. How does pair programming work?
    - Driver and the Navigator.
    - The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.
    - Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code.
    - The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer.
    - The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.
    - The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation.

## Things I want to know more about

- Node and some more conceptual stuff about it
- How Node works, technically (in a dumbed-down way)
- Alernatives to pair programming? Or maybe some programs/tools for pair programming (aside from Zoom or some other video-conference program)
