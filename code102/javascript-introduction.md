# Notes from 30 June, Assignment 2
## Javascript Introduction
### What is Javascript?
- Javascript is a just-in-time compiled programming language.
- Well known for as the scripting language for websites and non-browser environments (like Node.js Apache CouchDB, and Adobe Acrobat).
- JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages such as displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes.
- Javascript and Java are different in syntax, semantic, and use.

### Javascript Variables
Variables are containers for storing data.

There are three ways to declare a variable with Javascript:
- `var`
- `let`
- `const`

All JavaScript variables must be **identified** with **unique names**.
The general rules for constructing the unique identifiers variables are:
- Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
- Names must begin with a letter.
- Case sensitive (x and X are different variables).
- Reserved words cannot be used - like Javascript.

The `=` sign should be thought of as an **assignment** and not an actual "equal to" function.
