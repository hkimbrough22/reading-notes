# Notes for 28 June - Assignment 1
## Markdown 

- Markdown is a simplified version of HTML that focuses on content delivery and less on intense functionality or aesthetics.
- Markdown allows for simple formatting of the content you intend to deliver and is useful for static webpages as their is not a lot of functionality involved.
- It prevents you from having to learn a large amount of HTML syntax when all you need is to just to get some general information out.

## Useful Functions
- `# Heading 1` - each pound sign that you use creates a sequentially smaller-sized heading. Can use up to six (6) pound signs.
- `-` - the dash creates an unordered list that is initiated with a bullet.
- `1.` - this creates an ordered list that can be sequentially repeated for a numbered list.
- `[Reference Description](referencedfile.filetype)`- this creates a link to another file, URL, or image depending on what you would like to do.
- `*any character or word*` - this outputs italicized text.
- `**any character or word**` - this outputs bolded text.

Markdown has other useful features for you and I to find as well! Happy coding!
