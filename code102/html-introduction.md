# Notes from 29 June, Assignment 2
## HTML
### Wireframing
- Wireframing allows developers to define and plan for the hierarchy of their design for a website or application.
- When designing knowing where your product puts your information should be done prior to building anything with code. 
- Wireframing is also a great way to know how a user will interact with your interface without the distractions of colors, font, or styling.
- When creating a wireframe, some developers like to draw them by hand while others feel more comfortable using some type of software like [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) or [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).
- Here is an example of a hand-drawn wireframe.

### Tools
- Some tools that are handy for helping create effective wireframing include:
1. UXPin: Useful facilitation of building responsive clickable prototypes directly in your browser.
2. InVision: Allows feedback to get straight from your team and users through clickable mock-ups of your site design. Free!
3. Wireframe.cc: Technology to create wireframes really quickly within your browser: the online version of pen and paper.

### How to make your wireframe in six steps
1. Do your research.
2. Prepare your research for reference.
3. Map out your user flow.
4. Draft and Sketch. The details will come.
5. Add some details and test.
6. Turn your wireframes into templates/prototypes.


## HTML Basics
- HTML means Hypertext Markup Language.
- It is the code that is used to set up the structure of a web page and its general content.

### Anatomy of an HTML Element
- The main parts of our element are as follows:
1. The opening tag.
2. The closing tag.
3. The content.
4. The element.

 ### Elements can also have attributes
 - Attributes are added pieces of information about an element.
 - An attribute will always have the following:
1. A space between it and the element - or the previous attribute if there is more than one.
2. The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
3. The attribute value wrapped in quotation marks.

### Anatomy of an HTML Document
- `!DOCTYPE html` — The document type. This is required to make sure the document behaves correctly.
- `html` — Encompasses all content in the code aside from the doctype.
- `head` — Acts as a container for all the coding and styling not included in the content you intend to show on the webpage. This means things like language, character sets, keywords, and a description that appears when you Google your website. Other universal settings and elements are included here as well.
- `meta charset="utf-8"` — Picks the character set your document should use to UTF-8. This includes most characters from the majority of written languages.
- `title` — Title of the page. The title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in and when bookmarked.
- `body` — All the content that you want to show to your website viewers.

### Other Important Elements
- `<p>` - paragraphs
- `<h1>` - h6 = headings, same as markdown's "#" functionality.
- `<ul>` - unordered list
- `<ol>` - ordered list
- `<a>` - anchor tag
- `<href>` - allows to hyperlink images, websites, or other documents. This is more of an attribute tag for anchor tags.


## Semantics
- Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code or what effect it has on the functionality.
- These are some of the roughly 100 semantic elements available:

- `<article>`
- `<aside>`
- `<details>`
- `<figcaption>`
- `<figure>`
- `<footer>`
- `<header>`
- `<main>`
- `<mark>`
- `<nav>`
- `<section>`
- `<summary>`
- `<time>`
